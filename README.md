UK Renewable Energy Prediction 🌍⚡

📌 Project Overview

The world is shifting towards renewable energy sources to reduce dependency on fossil fuels and lower carbon emissions. This project focuses on analyzing historical trends in the UK’s renewable energy production and making predictions about future energy trends.

Why is this Important?

The UK has made significant strides in increasing the use of renewable energy sources like wind, solar, biomass, and hydroelectric power.
Policymakers and energy companies need accurate forecasts to make informed decisions on energy infrastructure investments.
This project helps understand which renewable energy sources are growing the fastest and how the overall energy mix is changing.

Objectives

✔️ Analyze historical renewable energy trends (1990-2020).

✔️ Identify which sources have grown the most over time.

✔️ Build predictive models to estimate future renewable energy production.

✔️ Provide insights to policymakers, researchers, and investors for sustainable energy planning.

📂 The Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains yearly renewable energy data from 1990 to 2020. It includes the following key variables:

🔹 Key Features

Year – The year of energy production.
Energy from renewable & waste sources – Total energy generated from renewable and waste sources.
Fraction from renewable sources and waste – The proportion of total energy that comes from renewable sources.

Renewable energy sources included in the dataset:

🌬 Wind, wave, tidal

☀ Solar photovoltaic

💧 Hydroelectric power

🌱 Biomass

🔥 Liquid biofuels

🏭 Landfill gas

🗑 Municipal solid waste (MSW)

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Before making predictions, we first explore the data to understand trends and relationships.


🔍 What We Analyzed:

✔️ Growth Trends Over Time – How has renewable energy evolved from 1990 to 2020?

✔️ Comparison of Renewable Sources – Which sources contribute the most energy?

✔️ Year-over-Year Change – How fast is the growth happening?

✔️ Correlation Analysis – Which factors influence energy production the most?


Key Insights from the Data

📌 Renewable energy usage has significantly increased since 2010.

📌 Wind and solar energy have seen the most rapid growth, replacing traditional sources.

📌 Hydroelectric and biomass have remained relatively stable.

📌 There are strong correlations between different renewable energy sources, indicating shared patterns of adoption.


📈 Visualizations Used

📌 Line charts – Show the increase in renewable energy over time.

📌 Stacked area charts – Visualize the contribution of different sources.

📌 Heatmaps – Analyze relationships between variables.

📌 Bar charts – Compare year-over-year changes.


🔮 Prediction Models

After analyzing past trends, we build Machine Learning models to predict future renewable energy trends.

Models Used

1️⃣ Linear Regression Model

A basic model that assumes a straight-line relationship between features and energy production.

Works well for simple trends but struggles with complex patterns.

2️⃣ Random Forest Regressor

A more advanced machine learning model that captures non-linear trends.

Provides better accuracy compared to Linear Regression.

How Predictions Work
The model learns patterns from historical data (1990-2020).

It predicts how much renewable energy will be generated in the future based on past trends.

The model helps us identify which energy sources will dominate in the coming years.

📊 Prediction Results Explained for Non-Technical Users

What Do the Results Mean?

📢 Renewable energy will continue to grow, with wind and solar energy leading the way.

👉 The UK's reliance on fossil fuels is decreasing, and this trend is expected to continue.

👉 Wind and solar energy are expected to grow the most, replacing older technologies like biomass and landfill gas.

👉 The government and energy companies should invest more in wind and solar infrastructure to keep up with demand.

Accuracy of Predictions

Linear Regression gives a rough estimate but isn’t very precise.

Random Forest performs much better and provides more reliable results.

Overall, the predictions suggest that the UK will continue increasing its renewable energy capacity over the next decade.
